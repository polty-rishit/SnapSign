## 🧠 Project Overview

Millions of people in India rely on **sign language** for communication, but there's a lack of tools that allow seamless interaction between them and the hearing population. This project offers a **real-time sign-to-speech translation** tool specifically designed for **Indian Sign Language (ISL)**.

Key objectives:
- Detect hand signs using MediaPipe
- Translate them into readable text
- Convert the text into spoken audio using Web Speech API

---

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe**  
✅ Gesture classification using **OpenCV** and custom logic  
✅ Instant speech conversion using **Web Speech API**  
✅ Smooth UI with **React + Tailwind CSS**  
✅ Flask backend to handle recognition logic  
✅ Designed for **Indian Sign Language (ISL)**

### 🔧 Customization Options:
- Want to **add a dataset or model training section**? I can include that.
- Need a **GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow** for Flask/React? I can help.
- Want a **dark/light switchable README theme** with embedded links to component files? That's also possible.

Let me know what extras you’d like — I can personalize this further based on your deployment or project goals.
